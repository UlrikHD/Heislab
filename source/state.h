 * @brief Primary function of state.h, takes care of all logic needed when
 * the elevator switches state.
 * 
 * The function is a single switch that contains all the necessary logic to care of
 * of a state switch of the elevator. The switch contains five cases:
 *      - @c IDLE - used only print out the state transition for easier monitoring of states.
 *      - @c MOVING - starts the motor.
 *      - @c AT_FLOOR - opens the door, starts the timer and removes completed order,
 *      - @c EMERGENCY_STOP - stops the motor, empties the queue and activates the stop light.
 *      - @c default - should in theory never be called upon.
 *
 * @param[in, out] p_elevator    Elevator to have its state transition handled.
 * 
 * @warning With the current setup in main.c, unlike every other case, 
 * the EMERGENCY_STOP-case will constantly be looped over by main().
 * This is desireable behaviour, but it also means you shouldn't add functionality
 * inside the case that you only want to run once when the state transition happen.
